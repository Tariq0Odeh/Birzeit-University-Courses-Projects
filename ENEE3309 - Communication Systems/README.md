# Course Description
Review of Fourier analysis, amplitude modulation systems (normal AM, DSB-SC, SSB-SC), frequency and phase modulation systems, stationary and ergodicity, transmission of a random process through a linear filter, the additive white Gaussian noise, noise in AM receivers, noise in FM receivers, pre-emphasis and de-emphasis, analog to digital conversion, pulse code modulation, delta modulation, differential pulse code modulation, transmission impairments over a communication channel, binary base-band and band-pass modulation schemes ( ASK, PSK, FSK, QPSK). The optimum receiver for binary data transmission.

# ENEE3309 Course Project
This project will cover amplitude modulation and demodulation. A normal AM waveform is produced using a simple switching modulator circuit. The resulting AM waveform is then demodulated using an envelope detector circuit. It requires to write Matlab Code for plotting modulated, and demodulated signals in both time and frequency domains. Evaluating the optimum value of the time constant that minimizes the mean square error between modulated signal and the output signal of the envelope detector.
