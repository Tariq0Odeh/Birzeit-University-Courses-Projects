# [Multicycle RISC Processor in Verilog](Project-2-Fall-2023-2024.pdf)
---
## Objective
Design and implementation of a Multi-Cycle RISC processor using Verilog HDL, characterized by a 32-bit instruction size and equipped with 16 general purpose 32-bit registers. The processorâ€™s architecture boasts a segmented memory layout, supporting diverse instruction types: R-type, I-type, J-type, and S-type, thereby enhancing computational flexibility. Central to its functionality is a multi-cycle Datapath, encompassing five distinct stages, governed by a state machine-based control unit. This initiative aligns with both educational objectives and practical aspects of contemporary processor design, offering deep insights into the complexities of real-world processor architecture and bridging theoretical principles with hands-on application in Multi-Cycle RISC processor design.
