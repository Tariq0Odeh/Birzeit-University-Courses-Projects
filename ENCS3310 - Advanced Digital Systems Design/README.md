# ENCS3310 Course Project
An 8-bit Comparator for signed 2â€™s complement representation numbers structurally by using several basic gates and entities with certain delays in two stages. The first stage implemented by using ripple adder/subtractor. The second stage by using Magnitude comparator and the sign bit.
