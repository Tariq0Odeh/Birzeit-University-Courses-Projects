# ENCS4310 Course Project 
Gender Recognition of a speaker has various potential applications such as speaker identification for securing access to confidential information or virtual spaces. As a human it is easy to differentiate between male and female voices. In this project, you need to use a technique for identification of males and females (maybe further adults and children) from their speech analysis. This analysis basically aims to predict the gender of the speaker by analyzing different parameters of the voice sample. It includes simple short-time pitch frequency (or fundamental frequency F0) which can be estimated from the short frames (20-30ms) using auto-correlation method. The fundamental frequency represents the vibration rate of the vocal folds of the speaker, which is usually high for the children, female speakers, and relativity low for the male speakers.
